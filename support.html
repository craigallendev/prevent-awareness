                <p>By partnering with various organizations and providing comprehensive support packages, our Prevent
                    officers have successfully guided many individuals away from extremism and towards a positive path.

                    However, if you feel uncomfortable speaking with us directly, there are several other trusted
                    figures you can turn to. Consider reaching out to a teacher, a local community organization, a faith
                    leader, your local council, or a healthcare professional for guidance.

                    Additionally, if you prefer to start by exploring resources online, there are numerous organizations
                    available to offer advice and support. These resources can provide valuable information and help you
                    find the assistance you need.</p>
